00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.280
From the day he walked two of us no longer spend

2
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.289
From the day I went, I live like people do not reason

3
00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:41.850
From the day I went I did not know for what

4
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.000
Maybe because he was out of love long

5
00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:50.009
Each day I try to hide all the pain I trite

6
00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.310
Each day I tried to hide the pain I thousand tears

7
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.740
His day to let go, he said, by fate

8
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.340
Charming no debt, so I took another

9
00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:07.810
Much heartache as he leave

10
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.340
I had no trouble clearing the tears welled

11
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.760
I&#39;ve lost people I love the most

12
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.600
You know I still cry every night about

13
00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:23.769
I&#39;m stronger, will not cry

14
00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:27.359
Kids will laugh, so I do not bother

15
00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:31.810
But time does not make you forget

16
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.200
I love you, love you for the heartache
